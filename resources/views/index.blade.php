	<h1>Translate - A Gender Transition Tracking App</h1>

@section('content')
	<p>For transgender and nonbinary people like myself, the prospect of gender transition is often a thrilling dream come true, but it can also be scary, confusing, stressful, and isolating. The purpose of this app is to provide a dedicated platform for people to document, track, share, and celebrate this life-changing process through blog posts and the creation of “Life Events” to keep track of major milestones. Functions I hope to add in the future include the ability to post pictures (to see how you've changed and to celebrate where you are), the ability to make individual posts visible to others (with a range of privacy settings), and the ability to integrate with crowdfunding platforms (to let friends and family help you afford the more expensive aspects of transition).</p>
